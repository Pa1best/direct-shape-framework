### :bug: Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for DirectShapeFramework. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :hammer::hammer:, and find related reports :mag_right:

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for creating Bug reports.
Before creating a new Issue, please check [Opened Issues](https://github.com/PalbestGit/oss-enterprise/issues) and [Closed Issues](https://github.com/PalbestGit/oss-enterprise/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

If you have found a new bug, [create a new Issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/new) and press Get started in Bug report section.

#### How To Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Create a single Issue for single bug** Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If possible, attach the Revit project in which the bug occurred**

### :computer: Submitting A Pull Request

#### Algorythm Of Proposing By Pull Request:
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository (Only for the first time)
1. Create a new branch
1. Make your changes and ensure that your feature works stable
1. Read this [Suggestions](suggestions-to-make-a-good-pull-request)
1. Push to your fork and [Submit a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to original repository

#### Suggestions To Make A (Good) Pull Request

* In general, commits [should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention) and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason, do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes.
* Commits should be named according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
* Make sure each individual commit is hygienic: that it builds successfully on its own without warnings, errors, regressions, or test failures.
