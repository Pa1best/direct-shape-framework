This light weight and easy-to-use library helps to visualize hidden Revit Geometry, Bounding Boxes, Vectors, lines, points and so on. 

## How it works?
This framework uses Revit API [DirectShape](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2017.1/bfbd137b-c2c2-71bb-6f4a-992d0dcf6ea8.htm#:~:text=This%20class%20is%20used%20to,may%20be%20assigned%20a%20category.) class to visualize hidden geometry as a real Generic Model instance. It helps you to analyze hidden geometry, check demensions and increase your performance in Revit API Geometry projects.

## Installation

For now you can download or copy local this project and build in release mode DirectShapeFramework library. Later I will set up this library as a .nuget package.

## Supported Revit versions

DirectShapeFramework is based on .Net Framework 4.7.2. It is supported by Revit 2019 or higher.
